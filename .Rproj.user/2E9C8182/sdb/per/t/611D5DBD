Netto, M.D.^1^; Sooryanarayana Varambally, Ph.D.^1^\n- **Data scientist:** Alcides Chaux, M.D.^2^\n\n^1^ Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL: ^2^ Centro para el Desarrollo de la Investigación Científica, Asunción, Paraguay\n\n\\   \n\n# Data analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}\nData analysis was carried out using 3 approaches: descriptive analysis, association analysis, and outcome analysis. Data was analyzed and plots were generated using `r R.version.string` from the R Foundation for Statistical Computing (Vienna, Austria). R packages from the [tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html) were extensively used.\n\n- **Last updated:** `r date()`\n\n\\   \n\n## Descriptive analysis\nThe analysis describes the [clinicopathologic, treatment and outcome](descriptive_cpo.html) features corresponding to the `r nrow(DF)` patients included in the dataset.\n\nThe analysis also descibres the marker features as evaluated in the `r nrow(marker)` TMA spots, including the extent (i.e., percentage of positive cells), intensity (absent, weak, moderate and strong intensity), and H-score. The H-score was estimated by multipling the extent (0--100%) by the intensity (0 for absent, 1 for weak, 2 for moderate and 3 for strong intensity), ranging from 0 to 300.\n\nWe describe marker features using two approaches: first, we describe the marker expression considering [all TMA spots](descriptive_marker.html); then, we summarized marker expression by cases (i.e., patients), using either the median or the maximum value of the considered feature.\n\nCategorical variables were described using frequency tables and barplots. Numerical variables were described using measurements of central tendency and dispersion, histograms, and density plots.\n\n## Association analysis (only invasive cases)\nFor the association analysis we included only the invasive cases (i.e., cases in which the TMA spot evaluated showed tumor cells). The marker values were compared considering clinical, preoperative, pathologic, treatment, and outcome features. In this context, marker values were considered as the outcome variables and the aforementioned features as the predictor variables. Variables were described using measurements of central tendency and dispersion, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nFor each feature (extent, intensity and H-score), either the median or the maximum value was used for the analysis. Thus, the association analysis was carried out by [median percentage](association_ext_med.html), [maximum percentage](association_ext_max.html), [median intensity](association_int_med.html), [maximum intensity](association_int_max.html), [median H-score](association_h_med.html), and [maximum H-score]((association_h_max.html).\n\nThe association was evaluated using either the [Mann-Whitney U test for the sum of ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann-Whitney_U_test) or the [Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal-Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance), depending on the features of the predictor variables.\n\n## Outcome analysis (only invasive cases)\nThe outcome analysis included [regression modeling](outcome_regression.html) and [survival analysis](outcome_survival.html). For each feature (extent, intensity and H-score), each case was categorized as showing high or low expression using the median values of the feature grouped in 2 levels, considering either the absence (i.e., zero value) or the median value of the feature distribution.\n\nOutcome variables included distant metastasis, tumor progression, overall mortality, and cancer-related mortality.\n\nOdds ratios were estimated using unconditional binary [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression). Hazard ratios were estimated using [Cox's proportional hazards regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model). Survival curves were built using the [Kapplan-Meier estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan-Meier_estimator) and compared using the [log-rank test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-rank_test).\n",
